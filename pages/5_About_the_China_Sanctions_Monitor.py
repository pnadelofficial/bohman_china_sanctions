While we regularly update the database with a view to maintaining a comprehensive record of PRC sanctions, we cannot guarantee––nor would we claim––it is exhaustive. This is particularly true for earlier years when China’s actions in this space were less closely monitored, and for ‘informal’ sanctions, which are rarely announced publicly and sometimes contested.

We collect data on PRC sanctions from a combination of official Chinese sources and international reporting. Publicly announced sanctions, such as those published by the Ministry of Commerce or Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are straightforward to track. Unacknowledged sanctions, including state-backed consumer boycotts, opaque trade restrictions, or selective regulatory enforcement, are more difficult to identify. To capture these, we rely on media reports and enforcement patterns. In some cases, timing and political context help determine whether a measure is a routine trade measure or a political action.

For the purposes of this platform, we define sanctions as state-initiated restrictions on economic exchange imposed to achieve foreign policy objectives. This aligns with Daniel Drezner’s definition in the Annual Review of Political Science, where he emphasizes that sanctions are not limited to coercion but also serve broader foreign policy functions, including denial, containment, and political symbolism.
