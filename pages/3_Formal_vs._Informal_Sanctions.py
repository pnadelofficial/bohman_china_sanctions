This graph shows Chinaâ€™s sanctions broken down by formality.

**Formal sanctions** are restrictions on economic exchange imposed by the state and which the PRC government acknowledges are motivated by political or security objectives. Formal sanctions are imposed under official laws, such as the Anti-Foreign Sanction Law, the Unreliable Entity List or the Export Control Law.

**Informal sanctions** are restrictions on economic exchange which are initiated or encouraged by the state but which are not officially acknowledged to be motivated by political or security objectives. In some cases, the government acknowledges having taken action but justifies the restrictions on other grounds (e.g., citing food safety regulations when imposing an import ban). In other cases, the government does not acknowledge being involved at all, attributing the restrictions to independent actions by commercial actors (e.g., patriotic consumers initiating a boycott).""".strip())
